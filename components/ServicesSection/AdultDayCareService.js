              Our adult day care program is designed to support older adults in a safe, structured,
              and enriching environment during daytime hours. We provide supervised care with
              personalized activities such as memory games, light physical exercise, social
              interaction, and creative engagement. Whether for respite, companionship, or daytime
              supervision, this service helps seniors thrive while caregivers take time to work or
              rest with peace of mind.
